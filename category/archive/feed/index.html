<p><strong>Connecting Actions: 20 dialogue organisations met in Paris to share dialogue solutions to violent and uncertain times</strong></p>
<p>From November 23rd to 25<sup>th</sup>, 20 citizen, interfaith and intercultural dialogue organizations came together in Paris for the first “Connecting Actions” symposium. Hailing from 13 countries, the participants shared their diagnostics of the particular challenges in their national contexts, but also global developments such as the continuing rise of populism, nationalism and extremism. Furthermore, the relevance and value of dialogue projects for addressing those challenges were identified and debated. The participants concluded that interfaith and intercultural dialogue is to be taken seriously, and understood as key to addressing polarization, extremism and racism.</p>
<p>On the basis of this, a clear desire for continuing to exchange best practices and reinforce each other’s work was identified. A follow-up conference is planned for the end of next year and an internal, virtual platform will serve to sustain the flow of information, experience and support. Several joint initiatives were discussed amongst participating organizations.</p>
<p>For Linda Vignac, President of SIETAR France, “<em>This initiative is important because it proposes to take active steps towards living together in a diverse world which I think is the only viable future for the world. Recent events make it obvious that not everyone agrees with this concept</em>”.</p>
<p>“<em>For decades now, forces who divide us along the lines of nationality, religious belief and cultural identity have organized and exchanged knowledge and experience. It is time to do the same. Connecting Actions is a vital step in building innovative networks of cooperation among useful and much needed national and international initiatives</em>” according to Ilja Sichrovsky, Secretary General of the Muslim Jewish Conference. “<em>The coalitions that this movement will allow are the best prevention tools for the multiple clashes that riddle our social fabric</em>”, adds Rafael Tyszblat, organiser of the event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connecting Actions was convened by the Muslim Jewish Conference (Austria), in collaboration with Coexister (France), Faith Matters (UK), Three Faiths Forum &#8211; 3FF (GB) and the European Union of Jewish Students – EUJS. The following organizations took part:</p>

<p><em><strong>Connecting Actions: First ever international symposium for citizen, intercultural, and interfaith dialogue groups to share best practices which will take place in Paris, France this month</strong></em><br />
<small>Paris, France ~ November 23-25, 2016</small></p>
<p>From November 23-25, just days after the first anniversary of the November 2015 Paris attacks, more than 30 interfaith organizations will gather in Paris to share best practices on interfaith dialogue. Entitled Connecting Actions, this is the first ever symposium of its kind.</p>
<p>The symposium, hosted by The Muslim Jewish Conference (MJC) in collaboration with Coexister, Three Faith Forum, Faith Matters, and the European Union of Jewish Students, serves to bring citizen, intercultural, and interreligious dialogue groups from around Europe to share their experience in the field: best practices, major mistakes made, and best lessons learned.</p>
<p>Connecting Actions, taking place in the backdrop of mounting religious tensions in Europe, will follow a format whereby for the first two days, participants will address in intense rounds of discussion topics ranging from pressing questions around the concept of active coexistence, methods and objectives of dialogue, challenges, combating radicalism, resources, social message and media coverage. The discussions will be facilitated with tested techniques and methodologies. The Connecting Actions gathering will conclude with an evaluation and a written document, which will then be communicated to the public via joint press conference on November 25.</p>
<p>The MJC is leading the effort to coordinate Connecting Actions, and aims to transition this symposium from a cohort of organizations to an accessible international network. “Dialogue is a serious business and if society paid more attention to those initiatives, the whole issue of radicalism and violence would be tackled very differently and much more effectively,” said Rafael Tyszblat, MJC’s Director of Content and event initiator and coordinator. “The coalitions that this movement will allow are the best prevention tools for the multiple clashes that riddle our social fabric. It&#8217;s time to show what we can do, collectively,” he explained.</p>
<p>In order to do this effectively and to engage a wider scope across geographical locations, MJC is collaborating with the French dialogue non-profit Coexister, an organization that has a base of 600 volunteers and 1800 members who relentlessly pursue their goals in line with the motto: &#8220;Diversity in faith, unity in action.” The Connecting Actions symposium will be the first of a series of meetings taking place in different countries in the next months and years.</p>
<p>Other planning contributing planning organizations include the European Union of Jewish Students, who under their ambit have around 35 member organizations across Europe working to support Jewish communities and their interfaith relations and the 3 Faiths Forum, a UK based interfaith organization with expertise in trainings for effective intercultural communication and dialogue across different faiths.</p>
<p>The conference received its name based on a global network that we created on Facebook in response to the refugee crisis, which began last summer. Called Connecting Actions, the group mobilized a few hundred young Muslims and Jews around Europe to help assist the refugees by providing food and clothing for them upon their arrival in Germany, Austria, and Hungary.</p>
<p>***<br />
ABOUT THE MUSLIM JEWISH CONFERENCE (www.mjconference.org)</p>

The organization boasts an alumni network of more than 700 members across 50 countries. Founded and led by Ilja Sichrovsky, the Conference aims to address the idea of otherness head on in the hopes of effectively dispelling this damaging construct and collaboratively addressing issues of discrimination.</em></p>
<p><em>The organization hosted its seventh annual conference in Berlin, Germany this August, in which 150 young professional Muslims, Jews, and people of other faiths from 33 countries met to bridge divides and engage in meaningful dialogue.</em></p>
